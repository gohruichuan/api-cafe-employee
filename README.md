# Creating of database

As part of the prerequisites, you installed and configured MySQL, which included creating a user. Now you will create an empty database.

To do that, first, you need to **log in to your MySQL instance**. If you are using a locally running MySQL instance, you can use the following command, replacing your_username with your MySQL username:

> $ mysql -u your_username -p

**-u is username** and the **-p option** is passed if the account is secured with a **password**.

The MySQL server will ask for your database password. Type your password and press ENTER.

Once youâ€™re logged in, use the **MySQL CLI** create a database called cafemanager using the following command:

> mysql> CREATE DATABASE cafemanager;

To verify whether you have created the database successfully, you can use this command:

> mysql> SHOW DATABASES;

Your output will be similar to this:

```
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| cafemanager        |
| information_schema |
| mysql              |
| performance_schema |
+--------------------+
```

## Connecting Nodejs to MySQL Database

In **index.js**, please change the **MySQL username and password** according to your local credentials.

_For this demo, I will not be using Environment Variables to minimise misconfigurations_

```
const sequelize = new Sequelize(
  "cafemanager", // Database name
  "root", // MySQL username
  "root", // MySQL password
  {
    host: "localhost",
    dialect: "mysql",
  }
);
```
